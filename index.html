    	<h2> Description</h2>
    	<h3>Quick Overview</h3>
    
			<p> There are archaeological signs of settlements in Ottawa from the last ice age. Native people with complex societies and distinctive ways of life made their homes in the area, living off the land.</p>
			<p>By the 1600s, French explorers started to arrive from Europe.</p> <p>Permanent European settlement came to Ottawa in 1826.Lieutenant-Colonel John By, RE, arrived in the Ottawa area to supervise the construction of the Rideau Canal, which was to connect a series of natural waterways between Kingston and           the Ottawa River. This new waterway would form a useful, military supply route between Ottawa and Kingston in case of an attack from the United States.</p> 
            <p>In 1857 on February 10, the relatively young city of Ottawa was officially chosen to be the capital of the United Province of Canada, a new territory comprising Upper and Lower Canada, which in today’s terms represents the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Ottawa continued to grow and evolve into its new          role as Canada’s Capital, despite some set backs.</p>
            <p> In 1900, The Great Fire, which started in the chimney of a house in what is now Gatineau, quickly spread to the timber yards and across the river to Ottawa. Much of the city was destroyed.</p>
            <p>During the Cold War era, top secret bunker that was designed to withstand radiation was built to protect the government and house top officials. It included living quarters, government rooms, radio broadcasting equipment, cryptographic areas and other essential services.During the Cold War era, top secret        bunker that was designed to withstand radiation was built to protect the government and house top officials.

            <p>Today, Ottawa is a source of pride for Canadians and is a wonderful place for to visit. It is a multicultural and busy urban centre that still maintains the green and scenic character recommended by Jacques Gréber many years ago. It is an exciting and dynamic place for residents and visitors alike.</p>
            <p>The rich cultural heritage of the country is displayed in numerous museums that are spread across the city. Museum of civilization, War Museum to name the few. The city also takes a pride in the Science and nature museum. </p>
            <p>The project "Open Data App" ,lists all the museus across Ottawa.</p>
